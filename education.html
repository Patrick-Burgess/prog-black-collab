                <h1>Computing in Education</h1>
                <p>
                    The application of computing in education has had my benefits; by providing access to vast amounts of information and resources. They facilitate interactive learning through presentations, simulations, and educational software. Additionally, computers enable distance learning, allowing students to attend classes and access educational materials from anywhere in the world. This has made education more accessible and inclusive, bridging gaps caused by geographical and socio-economic barriers.
